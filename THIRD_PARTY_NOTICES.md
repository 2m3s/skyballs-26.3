## Firmament storage overlay

SkyBalls's storage overlay (the `com.epic60869.skyballs.features.misc.storage` package and the SkyBallsCustomGuiScreenMixin, SkyBallsCustomGuiContainerMixin, SkyBallsSlotCoordsMixin and SkyBallsScreenChangeMixin mixins) is ported from Firmament:

- https://github.com/FirmamentMC/Firmament (branch mc-26.1)
- Copyright Linnea Gräf <nea@nea.moe> and Firmament Contributors
- Relevant source: src/main/kotlin/features/inventory/storageoverlay/, src/main/kotlin/util/customgui/, src/main/java/moe/nea/firmament/mixins/customgui/ and mixins/ScreenChangeEventPatch.java
- Code license: GNU General Public License v3.0 or later (GPL-3.0-or-later). Because of this, SkyBalls as a whole is distributed under GPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE).
- Assets: the storage overlay sprites under assets/skyballs/textures/gui/sprites/storageoverlay/ are Firmament's, licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY-4.0), by Linnea Gräf and Firmament Contributors.

Each ported source file keeps a Firmament attribution and SPDX header. The Kotlin code was rewritten in Java; Firmament's MoulConfig search field and button are vanilla widgets here, and its storage data is saved in config/skyballs/storage-overlay.json.

## NopoMod emoji assets

SkyBalls's integrated chat-emoji renderer uses the emoji sprite set and emoji-name data from NopoMod.

Upstream project: https://github.com/NopoTheGamer/NopoMod
Pinned source commit: 3243c18910c1b281f6585cd4657b349df4c60d50

The Gradle build fetches those upstream assets into the generated resource directory rather than copying the binary sprites into this repository. The upstream project's LICENSE applies to those assets/source materials.

The SkyBalls feature implementation itself is a separate Java implementation and does not copy NopoMod's Kotlin feature architecture.

The pet display's overflow-level calculation from the tab list (adding the XP of the capped levels to the "+N XP" overflow line and recomputing the level on the legendary curve, and the progress line format) follows NopoMod's `features/pets/PetDisplay.kt` and `OverflowPetLevels.kt`, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1.

The "Took N bosses to drop" slayer tracker (the kill and drop patterns, the one-second wait before counting a drop, counting Rift drops as Vampire slayer and skipping unknown drops after a world change) follows NopoMod's `features/slayer/BossesSinceDrop.kt`, licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1.

## Skyblocker

SkyBalls's /sj custom item and armor customization (the `com.epic60869.skyballs.custom` package and its mixins) is ported from Skyblocker:

- https://github.com/SkyblockerMod/Skyblocker
- Version: v6.10.4+26.2
- Relevant source: src/main/java/de/hysky/skyblocker/skyblock/item/custom/, the GUI utilities it uses under src/main/java/de/hysky/skyblocker/utils/, and the DataComponentHolder, DyedItemColor, ItemStack and EquipmentLayerRenderer mixins
- Assets: the customization screen sprites under assets/skyballs/textures/gui/ and the related en_us translations

Skyblocker is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0).

Each ported source file keeps a Skyblocker attribution line. SkyBalls replaces Skyblocker's config, NEU repository and scheduler dependencies with its own small implementations.

SkyBalls's Item Price Tooltip follows Skyblocker's AvgBinTooltip, LBinTooltip and NpcPriceTooltip (src/main/java/de/hysky/skyblocker/skyblock/item/tooltip/adders/) and reads auction prices from the same API (hysky.de). The container menu mixin that notifies slot listeners (used by the Chronomatron solver) follows Skyblocker's AbstractContainerMenuMixin.

SkyBalls's museum and accessory tooltips (`features/misc/MuseumTooltip` and `features/misc/AccessoryTooltip`) follow Skyblocker's MuseumTooltip, MuseumItemCache, AccessoryTooltip and AccessoriesHelper (src/main/java/de/hysky/skyblocker/skyblock/museum/, skyblock/accessories/ and skyblock/item/tooltip/adders/): the tooltip text and colours, the accessory family and tier report, and reading your accessories from the Accessory Bag. The accessory list comes from the same API (hysky.de) and the museum item data from NEU's constants/museum.json. Instead of Skyblocker's signed-in Hypixel API proxy, donated museum items are read from the museum menus.

Mouse Lock (`SkyBallsMouseLock`) follows Skyblocker's garden mouse lock (src/main/java/de/hysky/skyblocker/skyblock/garden/LowerSensitivity.java): its farming tool list (FarmingHudWidget.FARMING_TOOLS) and the barn area where the lock pauses.

## CommandKeys

SkyBalls's /sj keys GUI and macro system is a port of TerminalMC/CommandKeys (the `com.epic60869.skyballs.commandkeys` package, its mixins, the `skyballs_commandkeys` assets and translations, and the MultiLineEditBox entry in `skyballs.classtweaker`).

- https://github.com/TerminalMC/CommandKeys
- Branch: mc26.2
- License: Apache License 2.0 (a copy is included at assets/skyballs_commandkeys/LICENSE.txt)

Changes made for SkyBalls: repackaged, mod ID changed to `skyballs_commandkeys`, the command moved to /sj keys, the multi-platform service loader replaced with a Fabric implementation, and a one-time import of SkyBalls's previous command key macros added. Each modified source file keeps its original license header with a note of these changes.

SkyBalls's rarity item backgrounds, calendar date calculator and commission HUD style are ported from Skyblocker (see above).

## Skyblocker dungeon and experimentation features

SkyBalls's dungeon map, puzzle solvers, secret waypoints, room detection, terminal and device solvers, and experimentation table solvers (the `com.epic60869.skyballs.sb` package and the `assets/skyballs/dungeons` room data) are ported from Skyblocker v6.10.4+26.2 (LGPL-3.0), keeping Skyblocker's source structure. Skyblocker's config, location, scheduler and rendering classes are replaced by small SkyBalls stand-ins, and its custom world renderer is replaced by one built on Minecraft's gizmos.

## SkyHanni repository data

Several SkyBalls features use chat and item patterns, slayer XP and spawn costs, and the sea creature list published in SkyHanni's data repository (https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni-REPO, MIT License). The sea creature list is downloaded at runtime; the patterns and slayer values are included in SkyBalls's source.

## SkyHanni GUI Position Editor

SkyBalls's /sj gui position editor is an adaptation of the SkyHanni GUI position editor interaction model, including draggable HUD boxes, hover information, keyboard movement, and scroll-wheel scaling.

- https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni
- Relevant source: src/main/java/at/hannibal2/skyhanni/config/core/config/gui/GuiPositionEditor.kt and src/main/java/at/hannibal2/skyhanni/data/GuiEditManager.kt
- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 (LGPL-2.1)

SkyBalls's implementation is independently adapted to SkyBalls's own Java/Fabric 26.x HUD system and does not add SkyHanni as a runtime dependency.

## SkyHanni Current Chat Display

SkyBalls's current chat display (`SkyBallsCurrentChat.java`) follows SkyHanni's CurrentChatDisplay (src/main/java/at/hannibal2/skyhanni/features/chat/CurrentChatDisplay.kt): the channel-change message patterns and the channel names and colours. SkyHanni is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 (LGPL-2.1).

## SkyHanni Enderman and Blaze slayer features

SkyBalls's Enderman Slayer and Blaze Slayer features (`features/slayer/EndermanSlayer.java`, `features/slayer/BlazeSlayer.java`, the phase numbers in `features/slayer/SlayerFeatures.java`, and the SkyBallsSlayerPacketsMixin and SkyBallsHideFireballsMixin mixins) are ported from SkyHanni:

- https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni (branch beta)
- Relevant source: src/main/java/at/hannibal2/skyhanni/features/slayer/enderman/ (EndermanSlayerFeatures, EndermanSlayerHideParticles, LineToVoidgloomSeraph), features/slayer/blaze/ (BlazeSlayerClearView, BlazeSlayerDaggerHelper, BlazeSlayerFirePitsWarning, FirePillarDisplay, HellionShield, HellionShieldHelper), and the Enderman and Blaze phase splits in features/combat/damageindicator/DamageIndicatorManager.kt
- The Nukekubi skull texture comes from SkyHanni-REPO's constants/Skulls.json (MIT License)
- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 (LGPL-2.1)

The Kotlin code was rewritten in Java on SkyBalls's own HUD, world renderer and config. Entity colour tints are drawn as glowing outlines, and the landed Yang Glyph is found by checking the blocks around the thrown one instead of from block change packets.

## Short warp commands

SkyBalls's Warp Shortcuts (`features/misc/WarpShortcuts.java`) follow Skysoft's WarpAliases (https://github.com/Akinsoft/Skysoft, src/main/kotlin/com/skysoft/features/misc/WarpAliases.kt, LGPL-3.0) and SkyHanni's ShortenWarpCommand and GardenWarpCommands (https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni, LGPL-2.1): the warp names (Skysoft's list and SkyHanni-REPO's constants/Warps.json, MIT License) and the Garden's /home, /barn and /tp commands.

## SkyBlock Overhaul (SBO)

SkyBalls's Diana burrows, warp keys and Sphinx solver (`features/combat/DianaBurrows.java` and `features/combat/DianaSphinx.java`) are ported from SkyBlock Overhaul:

- https://github.com/SkyblockOverhaul/SBO (commit f5663baed4dd7748c80ba0fe52164bfb404ae4d5)
- Relevant source: src/main/kotlin/net/sbo/mod/diana/burrows/ (BurrowDetector, ParticleTypes), diana/guesses/ (ArrowGuessBurrow, GuessEntry, PreciseGuessBurrow), diana/sphinx/ (SphinxSolver, SphinxSession, SphinxQuestions), utils/events/DianaEvents.kt, utils/math/ (PolynomialFitter, Matrix, RaycastUtils), utils/waypoint/WaypointManager.kt and WarpPoint.kt, and the settings text in settings/categories/Diana.kt
- License: Apache License 2.0. SBO credits its arrow guess to SidOfThe7Cs's work in SkyHanni (https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni/pull/4916, LGPL-2.1) and its raycast helpers to SkyHanni's RaycastUtils.

The Kotlin code was rewritten in Java. Changes: waypoints are drawn with SkyBalls's world renderer, the guess colours and beacon beam are SkyBalls settings, and the warp keys use SkyBalls's warp settings.

SkyBalls's Diana achievements, mob HP display, rare drop announcer and Diana party commands are also ported from SBO (commit f5663baed4dd7748c80ba0fe52164bfb404ae4d5, Apache License 2.0):

- `features/combat/DianaAchievements.java` and `DianaAchievementsScreen.java`: diana/achievements/ (AchievementManager, Achievement) and guis/AchievementsGUI.kt. The achievement names, descriptions, rarities and ids are SBO's. The ones that need SBO's own server (mob kill totals, the kills leaderboard, Enderman Slayer 9) and "Download SBO" are left out.
- `features/combat/DianaMobHealth.java`: diana/DianaMobDetect.kt (the mythological mob nametags, King Minos's hits and the low HP alert).
- `features/combat/DianaTracker.java` (the drop side): diana/DianaTracker.kt and the lootshare tracking in utils/Helper.kt (the RARE DROP handling, lootshared drops and rare mobs, the since counters, back-to-back drops, the best Magic Find and the loot announcer).
- `features/combat/DianaPartyCommands.java` and the !demote, !carrot and !time commands in `features/misc/PartyCommands.java`: general/PartyCommands.kt.

## Diana profit tracker and Lobby Compromised

The Diana profit tracker (`features/combat/DianaProfitTracker.java`) follows SkyHanni's DianaProfitTracker (https://github.com/hannibal002/SkyHanni, LGPL-2.1), with SkyHanni-REPO's constants/DianaDrops.json list (MIT License). The mythological creature tracker (the mob side of `features/combat/DianaTracker.java`) follows SkyHanni's MythologicalCreatureTracker (src/main/java/at/hannibal2/skyhanni/features/event/diana/MythologicalCreatureTracker.kt, LGPL-2.1): the creature counts and percentages, the creatures since each rare one, the count added to the "You dug out" message, and the dig-out pattern from GriffinBurrowHelper, with the creature list from SkyHanni-REPO's constants/events/Diana.json (MIT License). Lobby Compromised (`features/combat/DianaLobbyCompromised.java`) is ported from Skysoft's DianaLobbyCompromisedWatcher (https://github.com/Akinsoft/Skysoft, LGPL-3.0), reading your party from chat instead of the Hypixel mod API.

## SkyOcean

SkyBalls's search-keybind and recipe-command workflows are adapted from the corresponding SkyOcean features:

- https://github.com/meowdding/SkyOcean
- Item search: src/main/kotlin/me/owdding/skyocean/features/item/search/ItemSearch.kt
- Recipe command: src/main/kotlin/me/owdding/skyocean/commands/CraftHelperCommand.kt
- Recipe autocomplete: src/main/kotlin/me/owdding/skyocean/utils/suggestions/RecipeNameSuggestionProvider.kt

SkyBalls's /sb search (SkyBallsStorageSearchScreen and the island chest, museum and highlight code in SkyBallsStorageSearch) is a Java port of SkyOcean's item search: features/item/search/screen/ItemSearchScreen.kt, SearchCategory.kt and SortModes.kt, features/item/search/matcher/ItemMatcher.kt, features/item/search/search/ReferenceItemFilter.kt, features/item/search/highlight/ItemHighlighter.kt, features/misc/ChestTracker.kt, data/profile/IslandChestStorage.kt and features/item/sources/. Its museum reading follows SkyblockAPI's MuseumAPI (https://github.com/SkyblockAPI/SkyblockAPI, src/main/kotlin/tech/thatgravyboat/skyblockapi/api/profile/items/museum/MuseumAPI.kt, MIT License, Copyright (c) ThatGravyBoat). SkyOcean's Olympus UI widgets are drawn with vanilla GUI calls.

SkyBalls's /sj recipe craft helper is a Java port of SkyOcean's craft helper (src/main/kotlin/me/owdding/skyocean/features/recipe/crafthelper/ and commands/CraftHelperCommand.kt): the recipe tree with leftover carry-over, the have/need evaluation, and the tree display. SkyOcean's code is licensed under the MIT License (SkyOcean License v1, section 1); SkyBalls reads recipes from the NEU repository instead of SkyOcean's repo library.

## Stella

SkyBalls's dungeon secret routes (`features/dungeons/DungeonRoutes.java`) follow Stella's secret-route system: the route file format (steps of waypoints and a path line), the waypoint types and labels, the room coordinate scheme (the blue terracotta roof corner as the origin, with the corner that holds it giving the rotation), step advancing on secret pickup, and automatic recording.

- https://github.com/Eclipse-5214/stella
- Relevant source: src/main/kotlin/co/stellarskys/stella/features/secrets/SecretRoutes.kt, features/secrets/utils/routes/ (RouteRegistry.kt, RoutePlayer.kt, RouteRecorder.kt, WaypointType.kt) and api/dungeons/map/Room.kt
- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)

Stella's default routes ("generated by Stella, recorded by Luckkytigger") are not bundled with SkyBalls. They are downloaded at runtime from Stella's route server (https://ether.stellarskys.co/routes/default.json) and cached in the SkyBalls config folder.

## Odin

Several SkyBalls dungeon features follow Odin's implementations:

- https://github.com/odtheking/Odin (main branch, Minecraft 26.1.2)
- Relevant source: `utils/skyblock/SplitsManager.kt`, `features/impl/skyblock/Splits.kt`, `utils/PersonalBest.kt`, `features/impl/dungeon/InvincibilityTimer.kt`, `LeapMenu.kt`, `BloodCamp.kt` (including its Watcher and blood mob head textures, mob skull data by DocilElm), `DoorHighlight.kt`, `PositionalMessages.kt`, the puzzle solvers in `puzzlesolvers/` (Ice Fill, Boulder, Creeper Beams, Three Weirdos, Quiz, Teleport Maze, Water Board and Blaze) with their data files `ice-fill-floors.json`, `boulder-solutions.json`, `creeper-beams-solutions.json`, `quiz-answers.json` and `water-solutions.json` (copied to `assets/skyballs/puzzles/`), and `render/PlayerSize.kt`

Ported to Java in `features/dungeons/DungeonFeatures.java` (splits, split PBs, mask timers), `LeapMenu.java`, `BloodCamp.java`, `BloodCampSkulls.java`, `DoorHighlight.java`, `PositionalMessages.java`, `OdinPuzzleSolvers.java`, `OdinTerminals.java` (terminal solvers from `features/impl/boss/TerminalSolver.kt` and `utils/skyblock/dungeon/terminals/`), `OdinDevices.java` (`SimonSays.kt`, `ArrowAlign.kt`, `ArrowsDevice.kt`), `mixin/SkyBallsPlayerSizeMixin.java`, `mixin/SkyBallsToggleSprintMixin.java` (`AutoSprint.kt` / `LocalPlayerMixin.java`), and `features/dungeons/SpiritBear.java` (`features/impl/boss/SpiritBear.kt`). Each file names Odin in its class comment.

## NoammAddons

SkyBalls's dungeon map ("NoammAddons (Legit)" style) and dungeon score calculator are ported from NoammAddons:

- https://github.com/Noamm9/NoammAddons (26.2 branch)
- Relevant source: `features/impl/dungeon/map/MapRenderer.kt`, `MapConfig.kt`, `utils/dungeons/map/handlers/HotbarMapColorParser.kt`, `MapUpdater.kt`, `ScoreCalculation.kt`, `utils/dungeons/map/utils/MapUtils.kt`, `utils/dungeons/map/core/`, `features/impl/dungeon/ScoreCalculator.kt`, and the checkmark and marker textures in `textures/gui/dungeonmap/` (copied to `assets/skyballs/textures/gui/dungeonmap/`)

Ported to Java in `features/dungeons/NoammMap.java` and `features/dungeons/ScoreCalculator.java`. The M7 dragon priority (the dragon that spawns first, Solo Priority, First Dragon Only) and the relic place timer in `features/dungeons/WitherDragons.java` follow NoammAddons' `floor7/dragons/DragonCheck.kt` and `floor7/M7Relics.kt`. NoammAddons is dedicated to the public domain under CC0 1.0 Universal.

## Skysoft Held Item

SkyBalls's Held Item (the `com.epic60869.skyballs.features.helditem` package and the SkyBallsHeldItemMixin, SkyBallsSwingSpeedMixin, SkyBallsHeldItemTextureMixin and SkyBallsHeldItemMiningMixin mixins) is a Java port of Skysoft's Held Item feature (https://github.com/Akinsoft/Skysoft, commit 79259743734d614a75f9d64bb8fa54163bfcfc1d): src/main/kotlin/com/skysoft/features/helditem/, config/HeldItemConfig.kt, the Held Item Update Fix from config/FixesConfig.kt, the ItemInHandRenderer, ItemModelResolver, LivingEntity swing and MultiPlayerGameMode mixins, and the pixel controls it draws with (utils/gui/PixelButtonRenderer.kt, PixelControlRenderer.kt, OverlayPanelStyle.kt, TextElision.kt, utils/SnapshotHistory.kt).

- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)

## Skysoft Diana Rare Mob Sharing and Lootshare Helper

SkyBalls's Diana rare mob sharing and lootshare helper (`features/combat/DianaRareMobs.java`) is a Java port of Skysoft's (https://github.com/Akinsoft/Skysoft, commit 79259743734d614a75f9d64bb8fa54163bfcfc1d): src/main/kotlin/com/skysoft/features/event/diana/ (DianaRareMobSharing, DianaRareMobTarget, DianaRareMobShare, DianaRareMobPartyMessages, DianaRareMobSupport, DianaRareMobRenderer, DianaRareMobEntityMatcher, DianaRareMobSignalSelector, DianaRareMobTitleRenderer, DianaDugMobParser, DianaMythologicalPetRequirement, DianaLootshareReadyMarkers, DianaLootshareReadyMessage), the mob matching and damage attribution from features/combat/ (SkyBlockMobEntityMatcher, SkyBlockMobTextParser, SkyBlockMobTracker, DamageSplashText, DamageSplashAttribution, CocoonMessageParser), data/skyblock/SkyBlockMobNames.kt and SkyBlockPlayerDeathParser.kt, and the party message queue in utils/chat/SkysoftPartyShare.kt. The party chat formats are kept, so shares and "Loot share secured!" work between SkyBalls and Skysoft players.

SkyBalls reads party membership from Hypixel's party messages instead of the Hypixel mod API, reads your pet from the tab list, and draws labels with its own world renderer.

- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)

## Skysoft Tooltip Scroll

SkyBalls's tooltip scroll (`features/misc/ScrollableTooltips.java`, `SkyBallsTooltipMixin`, `SkyBallsTooltipScrollMixin`) is a Java port of Skysoft's Tooltip Scroll (src/main/kotlin/com/skysoft/gui/tooltip/TooltipViewport.kt and TooltipPanSession.kt, com/skysoft/config/TooltipScrollConfig.kt, and the tooltip positioner / mouse scroll mixins): the pan session with smooth movement, the keyboard and mouse wheel controls, and the settings.

- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)

## Skyblocker Accessory Tooltip

SkyBalls's accessory tooltip (`features/misc/AccessoryTooltip.java`) is a 1:1 port of Skyblocker's AccessoriesHelper and AccessoryTooltip (https://github.com/SkyblockerMod/Skyblocker), with accessory data from Aaron's Mod via hysky.de.

- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)

## NoFrills

SkyBalls's M7 dragon and relic features (`features/dungeons/WitherDragons` and SkyBallsWitherDragonsMixin) are ported from NoFrills' Wither Dragons and Relic Highlight:

- https://github.com/WhatYouThing/NoFrills (commit 1ecf22d3b9cf49a22dcf592e142fc67688e64424)
- Relevant source: src/main/java/nofrills/features/dungeons/WitherDragons.java and RelicHighlight.java
- License: GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0)

NoFrills' dragon boxes and priorities come from Odin's WitherDragonEnum. The arrow-hit tracker was not ported.

## Skysoft Hide Status Effects

SkyBalls's Hide Status Effects (`features/misc/HideStatusEffects.java` and the SkyBallsEffectsInInventoryMixin mixin) is ported from Skysoft's (https://github.com/Akinsoft/Skysoft, commit 79259743734d614a75f9d64bb8fa54163bfcfc1d, mixin/EffectsInInventoryMixin.java and the Hide Status Effects option in config/GuiFeatureConfig.kt).

- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)

## Skysoft Server Info Display, Real Time Display and Profit Trackers

SkyBalls's Server Info Display and Real Time Display (`features/misc/ServerInfo.java` and the SkyBallsServerInfoPacketMixin mixin) are ported from Skysoft (https://github.com/Akinsoft/Skysoft, commit 79259743734d614a75f9d64bb8fa54163bfcfc1d): features/misc/ServerInfoDisplay.kt, ServerPingTracker.kt, ServerTpsEstimator.kt, ServerTpsProvider.kt, RealTimeDisplay.kt, config/ServerInfoDisplayConfig.kt, config/RealTimeDisplayConfig.kt and mixin/ServerInfoPacketMixin.java. The Profit Trackers (`features/misc/profit/ProfitTracker.java` and `ProfitTrackerHud.java`) follow Skysoft's Profit Tracker: features/profit/ (ProfitTracker.kt, ProfitTrackerTarget.kt, ProfitTrackerPresets.kt, ProfitTrackerRenderable.kt, ProfitTrackerHud.kt, ProfitReplenishCosts.kt, ProfitCraftingReconciliation.kt, FarmingKernelProfit.kt, SlayerQuestCostCapture.kt), config/ProfitTrackerConfig.kt, utils/gui/OverlayTextStyle.kt and OverlayPanelStyle.kt, data/skyblock/ParsedGardenPestKill.kt, and assets/skysoft/data/profit_tracker_presets.json, copied as assets/skyballs/data/profit_tracker_presets.json.

## Skysoft Keep Terrain Loaded and Slayer Target Highlighting

SkyBalls's Keep Terrain Loaded (`features/misc/KeepTerrainLoaded.java` and the SkyBallsKeepTerrainLoadedMixin, SkyBallsKeepTerrainChunkCacheMixin and SkyBallsClientPacketListenerAccessor mixins) is ported from Skysoft (https://github.com/Akinsoft/Skysoft, commit 79259743734d614a75f9d64bb8fa54163bfcfc1d): features/misc/KeepTerrainLoaded.kt, mixin/KeepTerrainLoadedPacketMixin.java, mixin/KeepTerrainLoadedClientChunkCacheMixin.java and the island list in config/WorldFeatureConfig.kt. Boss Highlight (`features/slayer/SlayerTargetHighlight.java`) follows Skysoft's features/slayer/SlayerTargetHighlighting.kt and config/SlayerFeatureConfig.kt.

- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)

## Odin Chat Commands

SkyBalls's Party Commands !fps, !ping, !tps, !f1-!f7, !m1-!m7 and !t1-!t5 (`features/misc/PartyCommands.java`) follow Odin's ChatCommands, and the Etherwarp Overlay (`features/misc/EtherwarpOverlay.java`) is ported from Odin's src/main/kotlin/com/odtheking/odin/features/impl/render/Etherwarp.kt (with Bloom's voxel traversal) (https://github.com/odtheking/Odin, commit ae6a1994b633f5b8e59bf1a88b50e5eab6a1b15f, src/main/kotlin/com/odtheking/odin/features/impl/skyblock/ChatCommands.kt).

The pet display's icon (`PetIconRenderer.java`) follows Skysoft's pet display (https://github.com/Akinsoft/Skysoft, commit 79259743734d614a75f9d64bb8fa54163bfcfc1d): features/pets/PetDisplayRenderer.kt, utils/renderables/decorators/CircularLayoutRenderable.kt and the defaults in config/features/pets/display/visual/.

- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)
